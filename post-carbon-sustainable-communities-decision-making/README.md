# Post-Carbon Sustainable Communities – Decision-Making Framework

This project investigates **decision-making strategies for post-carbon sustainable communities**, with a focus on system-level analysis, scenario evaluation, and multi-criteria assessment.

The work addresses how complex socio-technical systems—such as energy, mobility, agriculture, and digital infrastructure—can be evaluated and prioritized to support **sustainable transitions at the community scale**.

---

##  Project Context

Post-carbon communities require informed decisions that balance:
- environmental sustainability,
- technological feasibility,
- economic viability,
- and social impact.

This project was developed in an academic setting as part of a sustainability-focused course and adopts a **structured decision-making approach** to evaluate alternative development scenarios for future communities.

---

##  Objectives

The main objectives of the project are:

- To analyze sustainability challenges at the community scale  
- To evaluate multiple development scenarios for post-carbon transition  
- To apply **decision-making frameworks** to compare alternatives systematically  
- To support transparent and explainable sustainability-oriented decisions  

---

##  Methodological Approach

The project applies a **multi-step analytical framework**, including:

- **System thinking**  
  Identification of key domains such as energy, mobility, agriculture, tourism, and digital innovation.

- **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)**  
  Structuring complex decisions using multiple environmental, technical, economic, and social criteria.

- **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)**  
  Weighting criteria and alternatives based on relative importance and stakeholder perspectives.

- **Scenario-based evaluation**  
  Comparison of alternative post-carbon development pathways to identify robust and sustainable solutions.

The emphasis is placed on **decision quality, transparency, and reasoning**, rather than optimization alone.
