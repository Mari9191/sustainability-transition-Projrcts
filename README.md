# Sustainability, Energy & Decision-Making Projects
Academic and applied projects on sustainability, Transition, energy systems, data analytics, and decision-making.

This repository is a curated **portfolio** of academic and applied projects focused on **sustainability**, **energy systems**, **energy Transition**, **data analytics**, and **decision-making**.

The projects collected here reflect a system-level approach to complex socio-technical challenges, combining quantitative analysis, data-driven methods, and structured decision frameworks to support sustainable and informed solutions.

---

##  Scope & Focus Areas

The projects address real-world challenges at the intersection of technology, environment, and society, with a particular focus on:

- Sustainable and energy-efficient systems  
- Energy transition and climate-aware planning  
- Data analytics for energy, environment, and infrastructure  
- Decision-making under uncertainty  
- Multi-criteria and system-level evaluation (MCDA, AHP, scenario analysis)  
- Smart systems, IoT, and digital tools for sustainability
