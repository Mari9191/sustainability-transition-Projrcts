# Positive Energy District (PED) – Urban Regeneration Project

This project focuses on the concept of **Positive Energy Districts (PEDs)** as a strategy for sustainable urban regeneration.  
It explores how urban districts can be designed and managed to produce more energy than they consume, while improving environmental performance, social quality, and spatial integration.

The work addresses PEDs as **complex urban systems**, integrating energy, public space, mobility, and stakeholder perspectives.

## 📌 Project Context

Positive Energy Districts are a key pillar of the European energy transition strategy, aiming to transform urban areas into climate-neutral and energy-positive environments.

This academic project investigates:
- the PED concept and its policy context,
- urban-scale sustainability challenges,
- and the role of coordinated planning and stakeholder involvement in successful PED implementation.

The project was developed within an international academic framework and focuses on **district-level analysis** rather than single buildings.

---

##  Objectives

The main objectives of the project are:

- To analyze the PED concept within an urban regeneration framework  
- To assess energy efficiency and renewable integration at district scale  
- To evaluate social, spatial, and environmental impacts  
- To identify key stakeholders and governance challenges  
- To propose strategic pathways for PED development  

---

##  Methodological Approach

The project applies a qualitative and semi-quantitative methodology, including:

- **Urban and district-scale analysis**  
  Evaluation of land use, public spaces, building functions, and energy demand patterns.

- **Energy system assessment**  
  Identification of energy efficiency measures and renewable energy opportunities at district level.

- **Stakeholder analysis**  
  Mapping of actors involved in planning, implementation, and governance of PEDs.

- **Scenario and strategy development**  
  Definition of alternative development pathways and transition strategies for urban regeneration.

The emphasis is placed on **integrated planning and coordination**, rather than purely technical optimization.

##  Key Insights

- PEDs require coordination across energy, urban design, and governance domains  
- District-scale approaches enable higher sustainability impact than isolated interventions  
- Stakeholder engagement is critical for long-term PED success  
- Urban regeneration and energy transition must be addressed jointly
